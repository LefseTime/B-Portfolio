                <p>We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Here's something that's fun. We artists are a different breed
                    of people. We're a happy bunch. This is your world. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over
                    here. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the
                    puppy dog around and all that so. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be
                    overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.

                <p>Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Go out on a limb - that's where
                    the fruit is. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. This is an example
                    of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Son
                    of a gun. Anything you want to do you can do here. You can get away with a lot. In your world you can
                    create anything you desire. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There comes a nice little
                    fluffer. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered
                    dinner. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts.
